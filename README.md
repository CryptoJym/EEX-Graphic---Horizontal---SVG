# EEX Graphic - Horizontal SVG Flow Diagram

An interactive SVG-based flow diagram illustrating the EEX (Emissions Exchange) token ecosystem cycle, showing the relationship between CO₂ emissions, LCD tokens, and CO2O NFTs.

## Overview

This project provides a responsive, horizontally-oriented SVG visualization of the EEX emission tokenization flow:

- Tracks the flow from CO₂ emissions to LCD tokens
- Visualizes the aggregation of LCD tokens into CO2O NFTs
- Uses smooth curved paths and gradients to represent token flow
- Implements a clean, modern design with tooltips for additional information

## Technologies Used

- React + TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- SVG for graphics rendering
